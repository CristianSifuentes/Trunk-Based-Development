# Trunk-Based-Development
Trunk-Based Development is a streamlined Git workflow emphasizing short-lived branches and frequent integration into a single, shared branch (typically main or trunk). It's commonly used in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices, enabling faster development cycles and more frequent releases.
